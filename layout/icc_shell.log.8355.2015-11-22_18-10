Warning: Current cell: cell placement is incomplete and will be ignored (FPHSM-1829)
Warning: Pad cells edges are now open for terminal placement (FPHSM-0019)
Information: During terminal creation, some port-connected pins were detected as possible or likely candidates to be a PAD-type pin.  A tcl script, set_pad_attributes_on_cell_iic_top.tcl, has been created with a set_attribute command for each possible pin candidate. Some pins in this script may not actually be PAD-type pins.  Please edit this fileand correct any lines which are not correctly setting the value (true or false).  Then source this tcl script and then re-run the command which produced this message (place_fp_pins, initialize_floorplan, or initialize_rectilinear_block) again so that terminals are correctly processed.  The command has assumed that all candidate pins which are on padcells or bumpcells are to have terminals stacked onto the corresponding pins.  It has also assumed that all candidate pins which are on hard macros are to to have terminals created on the cell boundary.  If you are happy with these assumptions, you may forego the sourcing of the generated script and just accept the initial results .  If that does not give you satisfactory results, then use set_pin_physical_constraints to explicitly specify terminal locations. (FPHSM-1854)
Number of terminals created: 31.
