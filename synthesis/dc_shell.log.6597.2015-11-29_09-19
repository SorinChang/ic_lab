### Processing procs.tcl...
The following procedures are defined for use in this workshop.
They are NOT standard IC Compiler commands.
CES_procs:
 aa                   # always ask - Searches Synopsys help for both commands and variables
 async_domain         # set false paths between 2 clocks in both directions
 gen_reports          # Generates min/max timing, constraint and qor reports
 gui                  # Start or stop the GUI
 host_stats           # Display statistics of the current host (server)
 measure_time         # Run a command while measuring the time it takes
 report_placement_blockages # Display a summary of all placement blockages in the design
 report_route_guides  # Display a summary of all route guides in the design
 report_timer         # report the elapsed time of a named timer
 reset_timer          # Resets a named timer
 ring_it              # Creates a simple power ring around macros
 view                 # Display output of any command in a separate Tk window.
 vman                 # Display a man page using the GUI man reader or Tcl/TK.
